## Docker MLflow Server

This folder contains the configuration for an MLflow server based on Docker compose.

### Usage
This server can be accessed from the local machine, as well as from remote using ngrok. This configuration allows for local run evaluation while simultaneously allowing for tracking of run on Google Colab.
#### local
To access the server locally, the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5501 has to be visited.
#### remote
For remote access, the server uses ngrok with basic HTTP authentication. After starting the docker server, visit http://127.0.0.1:4040 to retrieve the current HTTPS address for the MLflow server URL and visit https://127.0.0.1:4041 for the Minio server URL.
